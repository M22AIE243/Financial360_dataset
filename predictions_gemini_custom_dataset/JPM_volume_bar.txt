The JPM Quarterly Volume chart reveals an initial surge in Q1 2023, peaking at approximately 840 million shares, followed by a notable decline through Q3 2023. Post-decline, quarterly volumes stabilized, fluctuating between 550 million and 590 million throughout 2024. This indicates a shift from exceptionally high early 2023 activity to a consistent, albeit lower, baseline volume in the subsequent quarters.
