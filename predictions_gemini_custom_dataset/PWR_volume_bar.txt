The PWR Quarterly Volume chart illustrates fluctuating activity from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. After a decline in volumes through Q3 2023, a significant spike occurred in Q4 2023, reaching a peak of approximately 81 million.

Following this peak, volumes in 2024 stabilized considerably, maintaining consistent levels generally between 56-58 million per quarter. This suggests a notable, likely one-off, boost in late 2023, with subsequent quarters reflecting a return to more normalized and consistent activity, albeit still above the lowest 2023 levels.
