The TSLA stock price chart from January 2023 to January 2025 shows significant volatility but strong overall growth. Initially, the stock surged from approximately $100 to nearly $300 by mid-2023, followed by a period of consolidation and moderate decline, generally ranging between $150 and $280 until mid-2024. However, the final quarter of 2024 and early 2025 saw an explosive rally, with the price climbing sharply from around $200 to over $450. This recent surge indicates robust upward momentum for Tesla shares.
