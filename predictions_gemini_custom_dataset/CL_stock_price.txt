The CL stock price has experienced significant movements over the past two years, from early 2023 to early 2025. After an initial period of fluctuation and a dip to around $66 in late 2023, the stock embarked on a strong upward rally, peaking at approximately $106 in Q3/Q4 2024.

However, a sharp correction has since occurred, bringing the price down to current levels around $90. Despite this recent decline, the stock still reflects substantial overall appreciation from its early 2023 starting point of around $75.
