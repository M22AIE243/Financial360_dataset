The NCLH Quarterly Volume chart illustrates fluctuating trading activity from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. Volume peaked in Q4 2023 at nearly 960 million shares, following an initial decline in early 2023. However, the data reveals a substantial decrease in the latter half of 2024, with Q4 2024 marking the lowest point on the chart at approximately 680 million shares. This suggests a notable cooling in trading interest towards the end of the observed period.
