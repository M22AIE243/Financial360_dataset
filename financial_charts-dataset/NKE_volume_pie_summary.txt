The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the data and provide insights.

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of NKE stock for the year 2023 and 2024. The chart is divided into eight sections, each representing a quarter.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The chart shows a relatively stable distribution of trading volume across quarters. The highest volume is in 2024-Qq (18.6%), followed by 2024-Qq (15.5%) and 2024-Qq (14.5%). The lowest volume is in 2023-Qq (8.1%). There is no clear trend in the data, but it appears that 2024 quarters have higher volumes compared to 2023. The relationship between X (time) and Y (volume distribution) is not strongly correlated. 

Note that without a traditional stock price chart, it's not possible to analyze the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price). However, the provided chart offers insights into the trading volume distribution of NKE stock over time.
