BABA's quarterly trading volume saw a significant decline from its peak of nearly 1.5 billion shares in Q1 2023. Volume largely trended downwards throughout 2023 and into 2024, reaching its lowest point of just over 1 billion shares in Q3 2024.

While there were modest quarterly rebounds, particularly in Q4 of both years and Q1 2024, the overall trend suggests a reduced level of trading activity compared to the early 2023 high.
