Here's a summary of the HCA Quarterly Volume chart:

The HCA Quarterly Volume displays fluctuations between Q1 2023 and Q4 2024, with volumes generally ranging from roughly 67 million to 88 million. After a relatively strong 2023, peaking at 84 million in Q4, there was a noticeable decline to 67 million in Q1 2024. However, the chart projects a robust recovery and consistent growth throughout 2024, reaching an anticipated new high of approximately 88 million by Q4 2024. This indicates a strong rebound from the early 2024 dip, surpassing prior peak volumes.
