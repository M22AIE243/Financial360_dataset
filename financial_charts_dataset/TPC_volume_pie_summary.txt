The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the data and provide insights.

**Analysis:**

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of TPC from 2023-Qq to 2024-Qq. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter.

**Key Trends:**

* The data is distributed across multiple quarters, with no single quarter dominating the distribution.
* The largest share is 18.9% (2024-Qq), followed by 16.9% (2024-Qq) and 14.4% (2023-Qq).
* The smallest share is 6.6% (2023-Qq).

**Relationship between X (time) and Y (volume):**

* The chart shows a varied distribution of volume across different quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend.
* The data suggests that the volume is relatively stable, with some quarters experiencing higher activity than others.

**Summary:**

The TPC quarterly volume distribution is relatively stable, with no single quarter dominating the distribution. The largest shares are in 2024-Qq and 2023-Qq, while the smallest share is in 2023-Qq. The data does not show a clear trend, but rather a fluctuation in volume across different quarters. 

Note that this analysis is based on a pie chart, not a traditional stock price chart, which typically shows the relationship between time (X-axis) and stock price (Y-axis). A traditional stock price chart would provide more insights into the stock's performance over time. 

If you provide a traditional stock price chart, I can re-analyze and provide a more relevant summary.
