The image presents a pie chart illustrating the quarterly volume distribution of Gill, but it does not depict a stock price chart. Consequently, I will analyze the provided chart and summarize it, focusing on key trends and the relationship between quarters and volume distribution.

The pie chart displays the quarterly volume distribution of Gill across eight quarters, with each quarter represented by a distinct color. The distribution is as follows: 11.3% (green), 12.7% (red), 14.1% (purple), 13.1% (brown), 12.3% (pink), 10.3% (gray), 14.5% (blue), and 11.5% (orange). 

Key trends indicate that the volume distribution fluctuates across quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend over time. The highest volume distribution is observed in 2023-Qq (14.5% and 14.1%), while the lowest is in 2024-Qq (10.3%). The relationship between quarters and volume distribution shows variability, with each quarter contributing a unique percentage to the overall distribution.
