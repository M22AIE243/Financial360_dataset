The chart displays SO's quarterly trading volume over eight quarters, from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024, indicating significant fluctuations.

Volume bottomed out at approximately 235 million in Q3 2023 before staging a strong rebound, culminating in a peak of nearly 295 million in Q2 2024. However, the latter half of 2024 shows a noticeable declining trend in quarterly volume.

This suggests that while trading activity saw increased momentum from late 2023 into mid-2024, interest appears to have cooled off towards the end of the observed period.
