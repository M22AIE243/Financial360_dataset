The "MCK Quarterly Volume Distribution" pie chart illustrates the proportional contribution of eight quarters, four from 2023 and four from 2024, to MCK's total volume. The volume distribution is fairly balanced between the two years, with 2023 quarters collectively accounting for 51.5% and 2024 quarters for 48.5% of the total volume. Individual quarterly contributions show a relatively tight range, from a low of 10.2% to a high of 14.9%. This indicates a consistent volume performance across all analyzed quarters, with no single quarter significantly dominating the overall distribution.
