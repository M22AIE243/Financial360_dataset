This chart illustrates TAP's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, covering both 2023 and 2024.

Volume contributions are relatively balanced across all quarters, ranging from a low of 10.7% to a high of 15.4%. The peak volume of 15.4% occurred in a 2023 quarter, closely followed by a 2024 quarter at 15.1%. This suggests consistent periods of strong volume performance in both years, with no single quarter dominating the overall distribution.
