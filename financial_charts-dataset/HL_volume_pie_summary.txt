The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the distribution of quarterly volumes.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of HL, divided into eight sections. The largest section is 2024-Qq with 17.7%, while the smallest section is 2023-Qq with 9.5%. The chart indicates that the volume distribution is not uniform across quarters, with 2024 quarters generally having larger shares. The relationship between time (quarters) and volume distribution is not linear, with varying percentages across quarters. Overall, the chart suggests that HL's quarterly volume distribution is concentrated in certain quarters. 

Note that there is no information about the stock price in this chart. If you provide the actual stock price chart, I can analyze it for you.
