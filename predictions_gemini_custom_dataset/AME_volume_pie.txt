The pie chart illustrates AME's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, encompassing all four quarters of both 2023 and 2024. Individual quarterly contributions to the total volume range from a low of 10.9% (a 2023 quarter) to a high of 14.9% (a 2024 quarter).

Collectively, the four quarters in 2024 account for a larger share, representing approximately 54% of the total volume presented, compared to the 2023 quarters which make up about 46%. The generic labeling of quarters (e.g., "2023-Qq") prevents specific quarter-on-quarter comparisons or the identification of seasonal trends.
