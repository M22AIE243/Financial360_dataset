ROST's quarterly volume displayed relative stability throughout 2023, maintaining levels around 140-145 million units.
However, Q1 2024 marked a notable dip to approximately 121 million, indicating a temporary slowdown.
The subsequent quarters in 2024 showed significant recovery and growth, with volumes peaking around 165 million in both Q2 and Q4.
This trend suggests increased market activity and a strong finish for ROST's volume in the latter half of 2024.
