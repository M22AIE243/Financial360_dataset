This pie chart illustrates the LNC's quarterly volume distribution across various quarters in 2023 and 2024.
Notably, the majority of the volume originated from 2023 quarters, which collectively represent approximately 65.4% of the total distribution, with one 2023 quarter alone contributing the largest share at 19.8%.
Conversely, the 2024 quarters shown account for a smaller proportion, totaling around 34.6%, and include the lowest individual quarterly contribution at 7.4%.
This indicates a significant shift or decline in LNC's quarterly volume contribution from the observed periods in 2023 to those in 2024.
