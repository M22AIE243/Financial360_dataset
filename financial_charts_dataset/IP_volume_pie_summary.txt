The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of IP (Intellectual Property) for the years 2023 and 2024. Here's a summary of the chart:

The pie chart displays the quarterly distribution of IP volume for 2023 and 2024. The largest share is 21.4% in 2024-Qq, followed by 14.1% in 2024-Qq. The smallest share is 9.0% in 2023-Qq. The chart shows a varied distribution across quarters, with 2024 quarters generally having larger shares. There is no clear trend in the data. 

As a financial analyst, I must note that this chart does not provide information on stock prices, but rather on the distribution of IP volume across different quarters. If you provide a stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it for you.
