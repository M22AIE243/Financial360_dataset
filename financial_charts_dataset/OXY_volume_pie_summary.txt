The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the distribution of OXY's quarterly volume.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of OXY stock. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter. The largest volume distribution is 16.5% in 2023-Qq, while the smallest is 9.1% in 2024-Qq. The chart indicates that the volume distribution is spread across multiple quarters, with no single quarter dominating the distribution. There is a relatively even distribution across 2023 and 2024. 

Note that this chart does not provide information about the stock price, but rather the volume distribution across different quarters. If you have a stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it for you.
