The GNRC Quarterly Volume Distribution pie chart visualizes the relative contribution of eight distinct quarters, four from 2023 and four from 2024, to the total volume.

Collectively, the four 2023 quarters accounted for 58.3% of the total volume, significantly outpacing the 41.6% contributed by the four 2024 quarters. Individual quarterly contributions ranged from a high of 16.8% (a 2023 quarter) to a low of 9.3% (a 2024 quarter). This distribution indicates a notable reduction in quarterly volume shares from the 2023 periods to the 2024 periods shown.
