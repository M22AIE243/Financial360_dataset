The chart is a pie chart illustrating the quarterly volume distribution of a stock, showing the percentage share of volume across multiple quarters. These distributions can be varied, highlighting quarters with the largest and smallest shares, or appear relatively stable. The context notes that such charts may indicate trends in volume over time, but do not display a direct relationship between time and stock price.
