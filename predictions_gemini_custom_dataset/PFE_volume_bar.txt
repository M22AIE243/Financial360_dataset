The PFE quarterly volume chart shows a significant increase in trading activity from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. Volume started around 1.4 billion shares in Q1 2023 but surged to peak levels of approximately 2.7 billion shares in both Q1 and Q4 of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in volume during the middle quarters of 2024 (Q2 and Q3), the strong rebound in Q4 2024 suggests sustained or renewed investor interest.
