The LPX Quarterly Volume chart displays the company's trading activity from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. Volume showed an upward trend, peaking in Q2 2024 at approximately 65 million units.

However, the latter half of 2024 experienced a significant decline, with Q4 2024 recording the lowest volume in the analyzed period, at around 41 million units. This sharp drop suggests a considerable cooling of LPX's market activity by the end of 2024.
