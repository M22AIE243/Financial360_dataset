The GL Quarterly Volume Distribution chart indicates a strong concentration of volume in 2024, which accounts for approximately 73.2% of the total volume displayed. A single 2024 quarter represents the largest share at 44.4% of the overall distribution. In contrast, all 2023 quarters combined contributed only about 26.7% of the total volume, with individual 2023 quarters showing relatively smaller and more even contributions. This suggests a significant increase or shift in volume towards the quarters in 2024.
