The EXK Quarterly Volume Distribution chart illustrates the proportional breakdown of trading volume across various quarters in 2023 and 2024. Notably, the quarters from 2024 collectively account for the majority of the total volume displayed.

The highest individual quarter's contribution comes from a 2024 quarter, making up 20.0% of the total. In contrast, 2023 quarters consistently show smaller individual percentages, with the lowest contributing 6.3%. This trend suggests a substantial increase in EXK's trading activity during the 2024 periods represented in the chart.
