The JWN Quarterly Volume Distribution chart reveals that the bulk of the analyzed volume, approximately 63.5%, was generated across the four quarters of 2023. In contrast, the four quarters of 2024 collectively account for a smaller share, roughly 36.5% of the total. The highest individual quarterly contributions were seen in 2023, with one quarter reaching 18.2%, while the lowest contributions (7.1% and 7.3%) were observed in two different 2024 quarters. This indicates a general downtrend in quarterly volume contributions for JWN when comparing 2023 to 2024.
