NSC's quarterly volume displayed a fluctuating trend from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. Volume peaked significantly in Q1 2023 at approximately 100 million units, before experiencing a notable decline over the subsequent quarters.

The lowest volumes were recorded around Q3 2023 (~73 million) and Q3 2024 (~72 million). While volumes in 2024 showed some recovery from the 2023 lows, generally ranging between 72 and 83 million, they consistently remained below the initial Q1 2023 peak. This indicates a period of moderation after an initially very strong quarter.
