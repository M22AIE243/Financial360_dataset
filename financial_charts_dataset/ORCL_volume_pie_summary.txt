The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of ORCL (Oracle Corporation) stock, not the stock price over time. 

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of ORCL stock. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter. The quarters are labeled as 2023-Qq and 2024-Qq, with each year having 4 quarters. The distribution of volume across quarters ranges from 10.2% to 14.5%. There is no clear trend in the data, as it appears to be a distribution of volume rather than a time series of stock prices. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary.
