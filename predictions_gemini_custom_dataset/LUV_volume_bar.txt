The LUV Quarterly Volume chart reveals a strong upward trend from Q1 2023, where volume started around 420 million, culminating in a peak of approximately 670 million by Q3 2024. This growth was relatively consistent, showing significant acceleration in mid-2024. However, Q4 2024 experienced a sharp reversal, with volume dropping substantially back to roughly 450 million. This significant end-of-year decline offsets much of the earlier gains, warranting further investigation into its drivers.
