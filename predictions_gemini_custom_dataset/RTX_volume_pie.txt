This pie chart illustrates RTX's quarterly volume distribution across eight distinct quarters from 2023 and 2024. The volume contribution per quarter shows considerable variability, ranging from a low of 8.0% to a high of 19.0%.

Collectively, the four 2023 quarters represent a slightly larger share of the total observed volume (51.3%) compared to the four 2024 quarters (48.7%). This indicates a relatively balanced, but not uniform, distribution of volume over these periods, with individual quarters showing significant fluctuations.
