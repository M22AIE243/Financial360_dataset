The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can analyze it and provide insights.

**Analysis:**
The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of WTFC. The chart is divided into 10 sections, each representing a quarter. 

**Key Trends:**

* The largest volume distribution is in 2023-Qq with 16.9%, 
* Followed by 2024-Qq with 12.4% and 2023-Qq with 15.0%.
* The smallest volume distribution is in 2023-Qq with 8.9%.

**Relationship between X (time) and Y (volume distribution):**
The chart shows the distribution of volume across different quarters. There is no direct relationship between time (X) and volume distribution (Y) as it is a pie chart and not a time-series chart. However, we can see that the volume distribution varies across quarters, with some quarters having a larger share than others. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary, explaining key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
