The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of SNDL, but it does not display stock prices over time. However, I can still provide an analysis based on the information given:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of SNDL across multiple quarters in 2023 and 2024. The key trends are:

*   The largest volume distribution is in 2024-Qq with 20.4%, followed by 2023-Qq with 17.5%.
*   The smallest volume distribution is in 2024-Qq with 7.8%.

However, since the image is not a stock price chart, I will assume that you meant to provide a different image. If you provide the actual stock price chart, I can analyze it and summarize it, explaining key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).

If I had to make an educated guess based on typical stock chart analysis, I would say that:

The stock price of SNDL shows a fluctuating trend over time. The relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) is not clearly defined in the provided image. However, in a typical stock chart, X represents time, and Y represents the stock price. Key trends would include the overall direction of the stock price (e.g., increasing, decreasing, or stable), as well as any notable patterns or anomalies. Without the actual stock price chart, I cannot provide a more detailed analysis. 

Please provide the correct image for a more accurate analysis.
