The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of INTC (Intel Corporation) stock, not the stock price chart.

Here's a summary of the image:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of INTC stock. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter. The largest section is 2024-Qq with 20.5% and the smallest is 2023-Qq with 9.0%. The chart shows a varied distribution across quarters, with 2024 quarters having a relatively larger share. There is no clear trend in the stock price, as the chart shows volume distribution, not price movement. 

If you provide the actual stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary.
