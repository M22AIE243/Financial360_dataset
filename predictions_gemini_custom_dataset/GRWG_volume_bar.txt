The GRWG Quarterly Volume chart illustrates significant fluctuations from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. Volume peaked at approximately 70 million in Q1 2023, with another strong period in Q2 2024 reaching around 65 million.

However, the latter half of 2024 saw a sharp decline, with Q3 2024 recording the lowest volume at roughly 35 million, and Q4 2024 remaining subdued around 40 million. This indicates a challenging second half of 2024 compared to previous periods and the prior year.
