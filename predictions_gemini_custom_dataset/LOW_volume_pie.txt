This pie chart illustrates the distribution of LOW's total volume across eight quarters, four from 2023 and four from 2024.

The 2023 quarters generally command larger individual shares of the aggregated volume, peaking at 14.5%. In contrast, the 2024 quarters show a slightly tighter and lower range of volume distribution, between 11.1% and 12.0%.

This indicates that while volume remained relatively spread out across all quarters, 2023 quarters individually contributed a larger proportion to the overall volume depicted than those in 2024.
