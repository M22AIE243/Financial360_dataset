SRCL's quarterly volume exhibited stability from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, maintaining levels around 25-32 million. A dramatic surge occurred in Q2 and Q3 2024, peaking at approximately 90-91 million, a substantial increase from prior periods. However, this heightened activity was temporary, with volume sharply declining in Q4 2024 back to pre-surge levels of about 24 million. This indicates a significant but short-lived period of increased volume during mid-2024.
