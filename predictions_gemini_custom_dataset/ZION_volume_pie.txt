In contrast, the quarters presented from 2024 collectively contributed a significantly smaller share, around 33.6% of the total volume.

A single quarter in 2023 recorded the highest individual contribution at 25.5%, whereas the largest individual quarter in 2024 only reached 13.8%. This suggests a notable decrease in ZION's volume share during the more recent 2024 periods depicted.
