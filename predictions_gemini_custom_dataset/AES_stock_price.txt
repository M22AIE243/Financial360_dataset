AES stock has experienced a significant overall decline over the past two years, dropping from approximately $25 in early 2023 to around $12.50 by early 2025.

The initial sharp decline to about $12 in late 2023 was followed by a period of volatile recovery and consolidation through mid-2024, with prices reaching peaks near $21. However, a renewed and sustained downward trend since late 2024 has brought the share price back to near its previous two-year lows.
