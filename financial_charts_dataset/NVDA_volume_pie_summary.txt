The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the distribution of quarterly volume for NVDA.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of NVDA stock. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter from 2023-Qq to 2024-Qq. The largest volume distribution is 15.4% in 2024-Qq, while the smallest is 6.7% in 2024-Qq. The volumes are relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the later quarters. The relationship between X (quarter) and Y (volume distribution) shows a fluctuating trend. 

Note that without a traditional stock price chart, I couldn't analyze the stock price trend over time. If you provide the stock price chart, I'd be happy to help with that.
