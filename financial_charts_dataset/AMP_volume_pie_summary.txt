The provided chart is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still provide an analysis of the data.

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of AMP. The chart indicates that the volume distribution across different quarters is relatively similar, with 2023-Q2 having the highest proportion at 15.5% and 2023-Q3 having the lowest at 10.2%. The quarters in 2023 and 2024 have a similar range of volume distribution, with 11.6% to 15.5% for 2023 and 11.8% to 11.9% for 2024. The relationship between X (quarter) and Y (volume distribution) shows that there is not a strong correlation, as the volume distribution is relatively stable across different quarters. Overall, the chart suggests that the volume distribution of AMP is fairly consistent across different quarters.
