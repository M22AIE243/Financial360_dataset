The PRU Quarterly Volume chart illustrates a significant decline in activity from early 2023 through late 2024. Volume peaked in Q1 2023 at approximately 142 million units, followed by a substantial drop by Q3 2023.

Throughout 2024, quarterly volumes have largely stabilized in a lower range, fluctuating between 90-100 million, with the lowest recorded at roughly 89 million in Q2 2024. This trend indicates a marked reduction in PRU's market engagement or liquidity compared to its prior year highs.
