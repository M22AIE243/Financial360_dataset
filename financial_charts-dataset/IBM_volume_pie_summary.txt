The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show IBM's quarterly volume distribution. Here is a summary of the image:

The pie chart displays IBM's quarterly volume distribution across multiple quarters. The chart shows a relatively even distribution of volume across the quarters, with 2023-Qq having the highest volume at 14.7% and 2024-Qq having the lowest at 10.6%. The volumes for 2023 and 2024 quarters range from 10.6% to 14.7%. There is no clear upward or downward trend in the data. The relationship between time (quarters) and volume is not strongly correlated. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary.
