The image provided does not represent a stock price chart; instead, it appears to be a pie chart illustrating the quarterly volume distribution of TEX. Here's a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of TEX, divided into eight sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024. The chart indicates that the volume distribution is relatively stable across quarters, with no extreme outliers. The percentages range from 10.1% to 14.6%, with the highest volume in 2024-Qq (14.6%) and the lowest in 2024-Qq (10.1%). The distribution suggests a consistent trading activity pattern across quarters. 

As a financial analyst, I would note that this chart does not provide information on stock prices, but rather on the volume distribution of TEX across different quarters. If you provide the actual stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it for you. 

However, if I were to make an educated guess, I would say that the stock price might be stable or show a slight positive trend given the consistent volume distribution across quarters. But again, this is speculation without seeing the actual stock price chart. 

Please provide the actual stock price chart for a more accurate analysis.
