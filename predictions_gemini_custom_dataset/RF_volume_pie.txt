This pie chart illustrates RF's volume distribution across eight unspecified quarters in 2023 and 2024. Overall, 2023 quarters accounted for approximately 54.6% of the total volume, significantly outpacing 2024's contribution of 45.3%. Individual quarterly volumes ranged from 10.1% (a 2024 quarter) to a high of 16.4% (a 2023 quarter).
