The "MAS Quarterly Volume Distribution" chart details the allocation of total volume across eight quarters spanning 2023 and 2024. Volume is fairly evenly split between the two years, with 2023 quarters collectively representing approximately 50.5% and 2024 quarters around 49.4%. Individual quarterly contributions vary from a low of 10.2% (a 2024 quarter) to a high of 14.5% (another 2024 quarter). This suggests a consistent, though slightly fluctuating, quarterly volume contribution over the two-year period.
