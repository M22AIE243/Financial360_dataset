The provided chart is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still provide an analysis of the chart.

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of TX from 2023 to 2024. The chart indicates that the largest share of volume occurred in 2023-Q1 at 18.4%, while the smallest share occurred in 2024-Q2 at 8.5%. The chart also shows that the volume distribution across quarters is not uniform, with some quarters having a significantly higher share than others. There is no clear trend in the data, as the percentages seem to fluctuate across quarters. Overall, the chart suggests that the volume of TX varies across different quarters, with some quarters being more active than others. However, without a time series chart or a stock price chart, it is not possible to analyze the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
