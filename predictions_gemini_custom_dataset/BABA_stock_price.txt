The BABA stock price chart from early 2023 to early 2025 reveals significant volatility, marked by two major peaks and a distinct trough. The stock initiated 2023 near $90, rapidly ascending to a high around $116 in Q1 2023 before experiencing a prolonged decline, bottoming out near $68-$69 by early 2024.

A strong recovery rally then lifted the price to a second peak of approximately $117 in late Q3/early Q4 2024, nearly matching its 2023 high. However, the stock has since retreated, trading in the mid-$80s towards the end of the period, indicating a recent bearish trend.
