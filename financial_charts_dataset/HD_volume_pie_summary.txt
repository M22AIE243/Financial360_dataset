The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of HD ( likely Home Depot) for 2023 and 2024.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of HD for 2023 and 2024. The chart is divided into 8 sections, with 4 sections for 2023 and 4 sections for 2024. The largest volume distribution for 2023 is 15.4%, while the smallest is 10.4%. For 2024, the largest volume distribution is 13.4%, while the smallest is 11.0%. The chart does not show a clear trend in stock price, but rather a distribution of volume across quarters. 

There is no clear relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) as this is not a stock price chart. However, we can see that the volume distribution varies across quarters. 

If you provide the actual stock price chart, I can analyze it for you.
