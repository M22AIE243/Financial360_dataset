The DECK stock price has demonstrated significant bullish momentum from early 2023 to early 2025. Starting around $65, the stock saw steady appreciation throughout 2023. A notable surge occurred late in 2023 and into early 2024, pushing prices considerably higher.

After some consolidation and fluctuations through mid-2024, the stock initiated another strong rally towards the end of 2024, ultimately climbing above $200 by early 2025. This indicates a robust upward trend, with the stock more than tripling its value over the two-year period.
