The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still provide an analysis of the data.

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of MAR (Marriott International) from 2023 to 2024. The chart is divided into eight sections, each representing a quarter.

**Key Trends:**
- The highest volume distribution was in 2023-Q3 (15.9%), while the lowest was in 2024-Q4 (9.8%).
- The volume distribution in 2023 seems to have a slightly higher average than 2024.
- The quarters in 2023 and 2024 show a relatively similar distribution, with a slight decrease in 2024.

**Relationship between X (time) and Y (volume distribution):**
- The volume distribution varies across quarters, with no clear and consistent upward or downward trend from 2023 to 2024.
- The data suggests that the volume distribution is not strongly correlated with time, and other factors may influence the distribution.

In summary, the pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of MAR from 2023 to 2024, with 2023-Q3 having the highest distribution and 2024-Q4 having the lowest. The distribution seems to be similar across the two years, with a slight decrease in 2024. There is no clear trend in the relationship between time and volume distribution. However, a proper analysis of the stock price would require a time series plot of the stock price over time.
