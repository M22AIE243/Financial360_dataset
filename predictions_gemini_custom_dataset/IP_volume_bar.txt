The "IP Quarterly Volume" chart shows a period of stable volume in 2023, hovering around $200 million per quarter.

A significant increase began in Q1 2024, leading to a peak volume of approximately $440 million in Q2 2024. While volume declined from this peak in the latter half of 2024, it remained robustly higher than 2023 levels, settling around $280-290 million in Q3 and Q4 2024. This indicates a strong upward shift in IP volume activity moving into and throughout 2024 compared to the previous year.
