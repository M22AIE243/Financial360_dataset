Here is a summary of the stock price chart:

The TREX stock price chart shows an overall upward trend from January 2023 to April 2024, with the price increasing from around $50 to a peak of nearly $100. However, the price then declines sharply to around $60 in July 2024. The stock price subsequently recovers and stabilizes, fluctuating between $70 and $80 from October 2024 to January 2025. The relationship between time (X) and stock price (Y) is generally positive, but with significant volatility and a notable correction in mid-2024. The stock price appears to have found a new equilibrium in the $70-$80 range.
