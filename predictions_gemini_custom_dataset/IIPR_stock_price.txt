The IIPR stock price has experienced significant volatility from early 2023 to early 2025.
After an initial decline to roughly $60 in mid-2023, the stock embarked on a strong upward trend, steadily climbing to peak near $128 in late 2024.
However, this impressive rally was followed by a dramatic and sharp sell-off, with the price plummeting back towards the $65-$70 range as of early 2025.
This recent steep decline has largely erased the gains from its year-long ascent.
