The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of RMD, but it does not display stock prices over time.

However, I can still provide an analysis of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of RMD across multiple quarters. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter. 

Here is a summary of the chart:
The chart shows a varied distribution of quarterly volumes for RMD. The largest volume is 17.6% in 2023-Qq (green section), while the smallest is 7.6% in 2023-Qq (orange section). There is no clear trend in the data, as the volumes seem to fluctuate across quarters. The volumes range from 7.6% to 17.6%. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary.
