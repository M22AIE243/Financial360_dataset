The PVH stock price exhibited significant volatility between early 2023 and early 2025. After largely trading range-bound between $70 and $90 for most of 2023, the stock experienced a substantial rally, surging to a peak near $140 in early 2024.

This peak was followed by a sharp downturn, bringing the price down to the $105-$115 range. The stock continued to fluctuate within this lower range through late 2024 and into early 2025, ultimately closing the period well above its early 2023 levels but significantly off its 2024 high.
