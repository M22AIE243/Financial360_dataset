The BLDR Quarterly Volume Distribution chart indicates that 2023 quarters collectively represented a larger share of total volume, at approximately 55.7%, compared to 44.2% from 2024 quarters.

The highest individual quarterly volume was observed in a 2023 quarter, accounting for 17.9% of the total, while a 2024 quarter recorded the lowest at 8.7%. This suggests a general shift towards lower proportional volume contributions in 2024 compared to 2023 within the period shown.
