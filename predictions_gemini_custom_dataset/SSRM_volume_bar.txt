The SSRM Quarterly Volume chart demonstrates a dynamic trend from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. After an initial dip in Q3 2023, volume saw a significant surge, peaking remarkably at approximately 300 million in Q1 2024. While volume moderated from this peak in the latter half of 2024, it stabilized around 150 million. This sustained level is notably higher than the average quarterly volumes observed in early 2023, indicating an overall increase in activity.
