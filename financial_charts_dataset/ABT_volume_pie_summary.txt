The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of ABT, divided into sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024.

Here is a summary of the image:

The pie chart displays the quarterly volume distribution of ABT across eight quarters. The distribution is relatively stable, with percentages ranging from 10.4% to 14.1%. There is no clear upward or downward trend in the data. The quarters in 2023 have distributions between 10.4% and 14.0%, while the quarters in 2024 have distributions between 11.8% and 14.1%. Overall, the chart suggests a consistent volume distribution over time.

As a financial analyst, I would note that this chart does not provide information on stock price trends, but rather on the distribution of trading volume across different quarters. If you would like to provide a stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it.
