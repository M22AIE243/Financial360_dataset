The CLVR quarterly volume chart illustrates extremely volatile trading activity from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. After modest volumes in early 2023, activity surged significantly to approximately 2.2 million in Q3 2023, followed by another sharp increase to an all-time high of about 3.0 million in Q2 2024.

However, this momentum was unsustainable, as volume drastically collapsed in Q3 2024 to negligible levels and remained extremely low through Q4 2024. This indicates a severe decline in market interest or liquidity for CLVR in the latter half of 2024.
