The VFF stock price displayed significant volatility over the past two years, beginning with a sharp decline from its early 2023 peak. After stabilizing and trading in a lower range, the stock experienced a dramatic surge in Q2 2024, briefly surpassing its initial highs. However, this rally proved unsustainable, as the price has since trended downwards, ending the period in early 2025 significantly below its starting valuation.
