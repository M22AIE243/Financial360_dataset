Here's a summary of the MTB Quarterly Volume chart:

MTB Quarterly Volume experienced significant fluctuations from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. Volume peaked initially in Q1 2023 at nearly 120 million, followed by a general decline throughout that year. After a rebound in Q1 2024, volume plunged to its lowest point in Q2 2024 (below 60 million) before showing a modest recovery through the end of 2024.
