The CLF stock price has experienced significant volatility and an overall downward trend from January 2023 to January 2025. After peaking above $22 in Q1 2023, it saw a general decline and consolidation through the remainder of 2023.

A strong rally in early 2024 pushed the price back above $22, but this was followed by a sharp and sustained decline. The stock is currently trading at its lowest point on the chart, around $9.5, reflecting a challenging second half of 2024.
