The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still provide an analysis of the data.

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of AIG. The chart shows that the largest share of volume (16.7%) occurred in 2023-Q2, while the lowest share (9.2%) occurred in 2023-Q3. The chart also shows that the quarters in 2023 and 2024 have a similar distribution, with some fluctuations. 

However, to analyze a stock price chart, I would look for trends such as an upward or downward trend, and the relationship between time (x-axis) and stock price (y-axis). 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary, explaining key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
