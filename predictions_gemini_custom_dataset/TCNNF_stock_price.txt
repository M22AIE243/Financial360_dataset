Over the past two years, TCNNF stock has exhibited extreme volatility. After an initial decline in early 2023, the stock experienced a significant bullish run from late 2023 through mid-2024, surging from approximately $4 to peak above $14.

However, this strong rally was followed by a precipitous decline starting in late 2024, with the price plummeting dramatically. By early 2025, TCNNF had lost most of its gains, trading back down below the $5 mark.
