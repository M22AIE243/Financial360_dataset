The CTSH Quarterly Volume Distribution chart illustrates an almost even split of total volume between the two years presented, with 2023 contributing 50.1% and 2024 accounting for 49.9%.

While the chart displays eight distinct quarterly volume percentages, specific quarters (e.g., Q1, Q2) are not identified, which limits detailed intra-year analysis. Individual "quarterly" volumes ranged from a low of 10.5% to a high of 15.4%. This suggests moderate variability in volume performance across these periods for CTSH.
