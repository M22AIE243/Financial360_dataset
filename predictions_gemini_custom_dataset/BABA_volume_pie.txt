This pie chart illustrates BABA's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, four from 2023 and four from 2024. Collectively, 2023 quarters accounted for approximately 53% of the total volume, slightly surpassing the 47% attributed to 2024 quarters.

Individual quarterly contributions ranged from a high of 16.3% in one of the 2023 quarters to a low of 11.0% in a 2024 quarter. This suggests a relatively even distribution of BABA's volume activity across these periods without significant concentration in any single quarter.
