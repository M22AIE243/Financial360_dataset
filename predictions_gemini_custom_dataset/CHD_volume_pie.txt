This pie chart displays the distribution of CHD's total volume across various quarters in 2023 and 2024. The volume is almost equally split between the two years, with 2023 quarters collectively accounting for 50.7% and 2024 quarters for 49.3%.

Individual quarterly contributions show variability, ranging from a low of 10.7% (a 2023 quarter) to a high of 14.4% (another 2023 quarter). This indicates a relatively even spread of volume without any single quarter dominating significantly.
