The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can still analyze the distribution of SCCO's quarterly volume.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of SCCO. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter. The largest volume share is 15.5% in 2023-Qq, while the smallest is 9.8% in 2024-Qq. The volumes are relatively stable across quarters, with a slight decrease in 2024. There is no clear upward or downward trend in the data. 

Note that the chart does not provide information about the stock price, but rather the distribution of quarterly volume. If you have a stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it.
