This pie chart illustrates DECK's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, comprising four quarters from 2023 and four from 2024. The volume is relatively evenly distributed, with individual quarterly shares ranging from 10.8% to 14.5% of the total.

Collectively, the four 2023 quarters accounted for approximately 51.6% of the total volume depicted, marginally exceeding the 48.5% from the four 2024 quarters. This suggests a fairly consistent volume flow across the observed periods, without significant dominance by any single quarter.
