The FHN Quarterly Volume Distribution pie chart illustrates the relative contribution of various quarters from 2023 and 2024 to the total volume. Quarters from 2023 collectively represent the majority, accounting for approximately 57.8% of the total volume, compared to 42.1% from 2024 quarters.

A 2023 quarter recorded the highest individual contribution at 20.2%, while a 2024 quarter showed the lowest at 9.8%. This suggests stronger overall volume contributions from the displayed 2023 periods relative to those from 2024.
