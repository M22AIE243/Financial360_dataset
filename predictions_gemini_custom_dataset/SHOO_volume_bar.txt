This chart, "SHOO Quarterly Volume," illustrates significant fluctuations in total volume from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. Volume peaked notably in Q2 2023 at approximately 59 million, followed by a sharp decline to its lowest point of 36 million by Q4 2023.

A strong recovery was observed in Q1 2024, with volume rebounding to 52 million, nearing Q1 2023 levels. However, subsequent quarters in 2024 showed more moderate volumes, generally ranging between 40-47 million. This indicates a recovery from the late 2023 low but a failure to consistently reach the high volume seen in early 2023.
