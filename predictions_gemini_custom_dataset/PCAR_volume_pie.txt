This pie chart illustrates the quarterly volume distribution for PCAR, detailing contributions from various quarters across 2023 and 2024.

The total volume is almost evenly split between the two years, with 2023 quarters collectively contributing approximately 50.5% and 2024 quarters around 49.4% of the depicted volume. Individually, the largest quarterly share observed is 15.5% (from a 2023 quarter), while the smallest contributions are 10.8%, representing quarters from both years.

However, the generic "Qq" labels for each slice prevent a precise quarter-on-quarter trend analysis or identification of specific high/low performing periods within each year.
