The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of EOG, but it does not display stock prices over time. 

However, based on the information given, here is a summary:

The pie chart shows EOG's quarterly volume distribution across multiple quarters in 2023 and 2024. The distribution is relatively consistent, with no extreme outliers. The largest share is 15.0% in 2023-Qq, and the smallest is 10.6% in 2023-Qq. The chart does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend. The volumes are fairly evenly distributed across the quarters. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary.
