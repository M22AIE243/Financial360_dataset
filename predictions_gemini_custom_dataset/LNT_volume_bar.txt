The LNT Quarterly Volume chart illustrates performance from Q1 2023 through a projection for Q4 2024. Volume experienced a significant surge, peaking at approximately 123 million units in Q1 2024, reflecting robust activity at the start of the year.

However, a notable decline followed this peak, with volumes falling through Q2 and Q3 2024, reaching a low of around 84 million units in Q3 2024. A recovery is projected for Q4 2024, with volume expected to rebound to approximately 100 million units, though this would still be below the Q4 2023 performance.
