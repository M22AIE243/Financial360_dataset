EXPE's quarterly trading volume displayed a period of relative stability and high activity from Q1 2023 through Q2 2024, with volumes generally exceeding 150 million. However, a notable shift occurred in the latter half of 2024. The third quarter saw a significant reduction in volume, which further declined to its lowest point by Q4 2024. This indicates a material decrease in investor interest or liquidity towards the end of the observed period.
