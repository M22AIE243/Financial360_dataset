The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. However, I can analyze it and provide a summary.

**Summary:** 
The pie chart shows CVS Quarterly Volume Distribution across multiple quarters. The chart is divided into 8 sections, each representing a quarter.

**Key Trends:**
* The largest volume distribution is in 2024-Qq with 17.3%, followed by 2024-Qq with 15.9%.
* The smallest volume distribution is in 2023-Qq with 9.1%.
* The volume distribution shows a relatively stable trend across 2023 and 2024, with a slight increase in 2024-Qq.

**Relationship between X (time) and Y (volume distribution):**
* The chart shows the distribution of volume across different quarters, with X representing time (quarters) and Y representing the volume distribution (percentage). 
* There is no direct correlation between X and Y, as the chart is a pie chart and not a line graph or time series chart. However, we can see that the volume distribution varies across different quarters. 

Note that a stock price chart would typically show the stock price over time, which is not the case here. A stock price chart would allow us to analyze trends such as the direction of the stock price, volatility, and patterns, but this pie chart provides a snapshot of volume distribution across quarters.
