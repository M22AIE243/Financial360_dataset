The LZB Quarterly Volume Distribution pie chart illustrates the proportional contribution of eight quarters from 2023 and 2024 to the total volume. Quarters in 2024 collectively account for approximately 53% of the total volume, slightly exceeding the 47% from 2023. The highest single quarterly volume recorded was 16.2% in 2024, while the lowest was 10.7% in 2023. This indicates a relatively even distribution with moderate fluctuations between quarters across both years, with a slight uptrend in overall volume in 2024.
