ACB stock displayed significant volatility and a general downward trend from early 2023 to early 2025. The price peaked at $11.30 in early 2023, followed by a decline and two distinct, sharp rallies in Q4 2023 and Q2 2024, which were both ultimately unsustainable.

The stock reached its lowest point of $2.89 around Q1 2024 before its second major surge. Despite these upward movements, ACB ended the period in early 2025 significantly lower than its starting point, averaging $5.79 over the entire timeframe.
