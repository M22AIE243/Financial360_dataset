This pie chart illustrates URBN's trading volume distribution across eight unspecified quarters, comprising four from 2023 and four from 2024. The volume appears relatively evenly distributed among these periods, with individual quarterly contributions ranging narrowly from 11.0% to 13.9% of the total. Notably, the collective volume for the four 2024 quarters accounts for 50.9%, slightly exceeding the 49.1% contributed by the four 2023 quarters. This suggests a modest shift towards higher proportional volume in the 2024 periods within this dataset.
