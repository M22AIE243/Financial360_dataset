The provided image is not a stock price chart but rather a pie chart showing the quarterly volume distribution of NCLH. However, based on the information provided, here is the analysis:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of NCLH, with each section representing a quarter. The chart shows that the highest volume distribution was 14.2% in 2023-Q2, while the lowest was 10.1% in 2024-Qq. The chart also shows that the volume distribution in 2023 ranged from 11.8% to 14.2%, while in 2024, it ranged from 10.1% to 13.2%. There is no clear trend in the relationship between X (time) and Y (volume distribution). 

However, if you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary, explaining key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
