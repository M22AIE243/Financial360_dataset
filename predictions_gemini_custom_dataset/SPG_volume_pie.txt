This pie chart illustrates SPG's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods spanning 2023 and 2024.

The volume is relatively evenly distributed between the two years, with 2023 quarters collectively representing approximately 51.0% and 2024 quarters making up about 48.9%. Individual quarterly contributions show a moderate consistency, ranging from a high of 14.0% in a 2023 quarter to a low of 11.5% in a 2024 quarter.
