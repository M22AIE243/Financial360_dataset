The image actually shows a pie chart, not a stock price chart. Here's my analysis:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of BIIB stock, divided into 8 sections representing different quarters. The chart indicates that the largest volume distribution is in 2024-Qq with 17.4%, while the smallest is in 2023-Qq with 11.0%. The volumes are relatively stable, ranging from 11.0% to 17.4%, with no clear upward or downward trend. The distribution appears to be fairly consistent across quarters, with a slight increase in volume in 2024. There is no obvious correlation between time (X) and stock price (Y) as this is a volume distribution chart, not a price chart. 

If you have a stock price chart, I'd be happy to help with that!
