The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of MCK, divided into sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024.

Here is a summary of the image:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of MCK, with each section representing a quarter. The chart is divided into 8 sections, with 4 sections for 2023 and 4 sections for 2024. The volume distribution ranges from 10.2% to 14.9%. The largest section is 2024-Qq with 14.9% and the smallest is 2024-Qq with 10.2%. 

As a financial analyst, I would note that this chart does not show a traditional stock price chart with time on the x-axis and stock price on the y-axis. Instead, it shows the distribution of volume across different quarters. Without a traditional stock price chart, it's not possible to analyze the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price). 

However, based on the pie chart, I can see that the volume distribution is relatively consistent across quarters, with no dramatic changes. This could indicate a stable market for MCK. 

If you could provide the actual stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it and provide insights on key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
