The provided chart is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It represents the quarterly volume distribution of MMM (3M) and not a stock price chart.

However, based on the information provided, here is the analysis:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of MMM. The chart indicates that the volume distribution across different quarters in 2023 and 2024 is relatively stable. The largest volume distribution is 16.7% in 2024-Qq and the smallest is 9.4% in 2024-Qq. The volume distribution in 2023 ranges from 11.9% to 12.2%, while in 2024, it ranges from 9.4% to 16.7%. There is no clear trend in the relationship between X (time) and the volume distribution. 

However, if we assume that the question refers to the relationship between the quarters and the stock price, and if we had a stock price chart, then it would likely show a stable trend with minor fluctuations. Without a stock price chart, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
