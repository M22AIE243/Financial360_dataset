KLAC stock experienced a significant bull run from early 2023, starting near its lowest point of $350.30. This upward trend led to an all-time high of $886.25 around July/August 2024, more than doubling its initial value.

The latter half of 2024, however, saw a sharp correction, with the price declining considerably from its peak. By early 2025, the stock had stabilized in the $600-$650 range, reflecting a notable retreat from its highs but still well above its starting position.
