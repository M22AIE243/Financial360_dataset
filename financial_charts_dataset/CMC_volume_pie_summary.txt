The image does not depict a stock price chart; rather, it shows a pie chart illustrating the quarterly volume distribution of CMC, divided into sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024. 

The chart indicates that the largest volume distribution occurred in 2023-Qq at 16.2%, while the lowest was in 2024-Qq at 10.3%. 

There is no clear trend in the data; however, the quarterly volume distribution seems to be fluctuating. 

As this is not a stock price chart, the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) cannot be determined. 

However, if the Y-axis represented the volume distribution, then as X (time) progresses, the volume distribution changes, with some quarters having higher distributions than others.
