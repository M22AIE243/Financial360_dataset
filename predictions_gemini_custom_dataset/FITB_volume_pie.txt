This chart illustrates FITB's quarterly volume distribution across selected periods in 2023 and 2024.

Quarters from 2023 collectively represent the majority of the total volume, accounting for approximately 59.1%, with one quarter peaking at 19.7%. Conversely, the observed quarters from 2024 constitute a smaller share, contributing around 40.8% of the total volume. This suggests a notable shift or potential decline in overall volume contribution in the more recent 2024 quarters shown, compared to 2023.
