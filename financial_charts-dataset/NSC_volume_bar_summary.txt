Here is a summary of the stock price chart:

The chart shows the quarterly volume of NSC stock from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. The total volume started at approximately $1.0 billion in Q1 2023 and decreased to around $0.9 billion in Q2 2023. The volume then fluctuated between $0.7 billion and $0.8 billion for the remaining quarters, with a slight increase in Q1 2024. Overall, the trend indicates a decline in total volume from Q1 2023, followed by a period of relatively stable, but lower, volumes. The relationship between time (X) and total volume (Y) appears to be inversely correlated.
