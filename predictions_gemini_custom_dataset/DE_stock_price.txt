The DE stock price experienced significant volatility between early 2023 and early 2025. After dipping to lows around $335 in mid-2023 and mid-$340s in mid-2024, the stock staged a strong rally in the latter half of 2024. This surge led to the stock reaching multi-year highs near $460 in late 2024, though it has since seen a sharp pullback from those peak levels.
