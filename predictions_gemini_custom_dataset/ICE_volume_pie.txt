This pie chart illustrates the distribution of ICE's total volume across eight distinct quarters, four from 2023 and four from 2024.

Volume contributions are relatively consistent across these periods, ranging from a low of 10.9% (a 2023 quarter) to a high of 14.7% (a 2024 quarter).

Collectively, the four 2024 quarters account for approximately 51% of the total volume shown, slightly outpacing the 2023 quarters' combined contribution of about 49%. This suggests a modest shift towards higher volume concentration in the more recent periods depicted.
