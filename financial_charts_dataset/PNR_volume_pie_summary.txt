The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of PNR, divided into sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024.

Here is a summary of the chart:

The pie chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of PNR, with the largest share in 2023-Qq at 14.7%, followed by 2024-Qq at 14.1%, and 2023-Qq at 14.1% and 13.6% and 13%. The lowest quarterly volume distribution is in 2023-Qq at 9.9%. 

As this is not a stock price chart, I couldn't find any key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price). 

If you provide the actual stock price chart, I can assist you with analyzing it.
