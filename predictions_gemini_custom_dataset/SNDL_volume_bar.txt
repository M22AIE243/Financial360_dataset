SNDL's quarterly trading volume exhibited significant volatility from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024. The volume peaked dramatically in Q2 2024, reaching approximately 360 million shares, which was the highest during this period. However, the latter half of 2024 saw a substantial downturn, with volumes dropping to their lowest points of approximately 140-145 million shares in both Q3 and Q4. This indicates a recent notable slowdown in trading activity after a period of heightened interest.
