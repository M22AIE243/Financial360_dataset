The DG Quarterly Volume chart illustrates a significant overall increase in volume from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024, despite some volatility. Volume steadily grew throughout 2023, rising from approximately 125 million in Q1 to over 210 million by year-end.

A noticeable dip occurred in early 2024, with volumes falling to around 145 million in Q1 2024. However, DG experienced a strong recovery in the latter half of 2024, achieving record quarterly volumes of approximately 265 million in both Q3 and Q4. This demonstrates robust growth over the two-year period, with Q4 2024 volumes more than double those of Q1 2023.
