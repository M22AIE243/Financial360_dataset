The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of FNV, but it does not display stock prices over time.

However, based on the information given, here is a summary:

* The chart shows the quarterly volume distribution of FNV across 8 quarters.
* The key trend is that the volume distribution varies across quarters, with the largest share being 15.8% in one of the 2023 quarters and the smallest being 8.2% in another 2023 quarter.
* There is no clear relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) as this is not a stock price chart; instead, it shows volume distribution.

If you provide a stock price chart, I can analyze it and provide a summary, explaining key trends and the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price).
