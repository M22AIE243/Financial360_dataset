The image provided does not show a stock price chart but rather a pie chart illustrating the quarterly volume distribution of PVH. The chart displays the distribution across multiple quarters in 2023 and 2024.

**Analysis:**

*   The chart does not depict a stock price over time but rather the volume distribution across different quarters.
*   There is no clear trend in stock price movement over time, as the chart does not provide such information.
*   The relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) cannot be determined from this chart, as it does not display stock prices.

However, if we were to assume that the question pertains to the trend of volume distribution over time, here's a summary:

The PVH quarterly volume distribution shows a relatively stable trend across quarters in 2023 and 2024. The distribution ranges from 10.4% to 14.8%, with no clear upward or downward trend. The highest volume distribution was in 2023-Qq at 14.8%, and the lowest was in 2024-Qq at 10.4%. The distribution seems to be relatively consistent, with most quarters having a distribution between 11% and 14%. 

If you provide an actual stock price chart, I can give a more accurate analysis.
