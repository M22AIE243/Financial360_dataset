The provided chart is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It shows the quarterly volume distribution of OGI. 

The stock volume distribution is largely split between Q3 2023 (20.1%) and Q4 2023 (19.2%), and Q2 2024 (21.6%). The least volume was recorded in Q2 2023 (4%). The graph shows no clear trend in relation to X (time) and Y (volume). 

However, assuming that a stock price chart was intended, a proper analysis would include an explanation of the relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price). In this case, I would say that the relationship between X and Y is usually a correlation, where an increase in X usually results in an increase or decrease in Y. Without a proper stock price chart, I am unable to provide further analysis.
