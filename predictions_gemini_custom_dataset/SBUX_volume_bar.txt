Here's a summary of the SBUX Quarterly Volume:

SBUX quarterly trading volume generally trended upwards from Q1 2023, starting around 38 million shares. Volumes saw a notable surge in mid-2024, peaking significantly in Q3 2024 at approximately 90 million shares. However, the latest quarter, Q4 2024, indicates a substantial pullback in volume, falling to roughly 50 million shares after the preceding quarter's peak. This suggests a period of elevated trading activity followed by a cooling in the most recent quarter.
