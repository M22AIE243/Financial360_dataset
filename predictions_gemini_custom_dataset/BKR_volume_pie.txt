This pie chart displays BKR's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, likely representing four quarters each for 2023 and 2024.

In 2023, quarterly volumes remained relatively consistent, ranging narrowly from 12.0% to 12.7% of the total. Conversely, 2024 quarters showed greater variance, with one quarter contributing a significant 16.7%, marking the highest volume share among all periods.

However, another 2024 quarter represented the lowest share at 11.1%. This suggests more fluctuating performance in 2024, culminating in a peak quarterly volume for BKR.
