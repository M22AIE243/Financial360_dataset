This OGI Quarterly Volume Distribution chart illustrates that the majority of recorded volume, approximately 61.2%, originated from quarters designated as "2024-Qq." In contrast, quarters labeled "2023-Qq" collectively accounted for a smaller share, about 38.7% of the total distribution.

The largest individual quarterly contribution was 21.6% (from a 2024-Qq period), while the smallest individual volumes were around 4.0-4.4%, observed within the 2023-Qq periods. This indicates a significant shift or increase in activity or reporting volume into the 2024 quarters compared to 2023.
