The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of CMI, but it does not display stock prices over time. Therefore, I will analyze the pie chart and summarize it.

The pie chart shows that the largest volume distribution is in 2024-Qq with 34.7%, followed by 2023-Qq with 11.4%. The remaining quarters have smaller distributions, ranging from 6.9% to 10.7%. There is no clear trend in the data, as it appears to be a snapshot of quarterly volume distribution rather than a time series. The relationship between the quarters and volume distribution is not linear, with some quarters having significantly larger distributions than others. Overall, the chart suggests that 2024-Qq had the largest volume distribution. 

If you provide a stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it.
