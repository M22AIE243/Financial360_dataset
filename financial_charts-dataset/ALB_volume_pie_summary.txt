The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of ALB, but it does not display stock prices over time. Therefore, I will summarize the key trends and relationships between quarters and their corresponding volume distributions.

### Summary:
- The pie chart illustrates the quarterly volume distribution of ALB across multiple quarters in 2023 and 2024.
- The volume distribution varies across quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend over time.
- The largest volume distribution is 16.6% (2024-Qq), and the smallest is 8.2% (2023-Qq).

### Key Trends:
- **Volume Distribution Ranges**: The percentages range from 8.2% to 16.6%, indicating variability in quarterly volumes.
- **Quarterly Variations**: Each quarter has a distinct volume distribution, with 2024 quarters showing significant portions (13.4%, 15.0%, and 16.6%).
- **No Clear Trend**: There is no evident consistent increase or decrease in volume distribution over the quarters shown.

### Relationship:
- The relationship between quarters (X) and volume distribution percentages (Y) is not linear or consistently trending. Instead, it shows fluctuations across different quarters.

If you have a stock price chart that you would like analyzed, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist with summarizing key trends and the relationship between time and stock price.
