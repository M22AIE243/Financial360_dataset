K Stock experienced moderate volatility from early 2023 to mid-2024, initially declining from highs near $62 to a low around $46 by Q4 2023, then gradually recovering to the mid-$50s.

However, in late August 2024, the stock underwent a dramatic and sudden surge, sharply increasing from approximately $55 to nearly $80.

This significant upward revaluation established a new, much higher trading plateau.

K Stock has consistently maintained these elevated price levels, hovering around $79-$80, through early 2025.
