The provided image is a pie chart, not a stock price chart. It appears to show the quarterly volume distribution of WEC, divided into sections representing different quarters of 2023 and 2024.

Here is a summary of the image:

The WEC quarterly volume distribution is depicted in a pie chart, showing the proportion of volume for each quarter. The chart is divided into 8 sections, with 4 sections for 2023 and 4 sections for 2024. The volume distribution ranges from 9.2% to 15.7%. The largest volume is in 2024-Qq (15.7%) and the smallest is in 2023-Qq (9.2%). 

As a financial analyst, I would note that this chart does not show a traditional stock price chart with time on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. Instead, it shows the distribution of volume across different quarters. 

If you could provide the actual stock price chart, I would be happy to analyze it and provide a summary. 

However, based on the provided image, there is no clear relationship between X (time) and Y (stock price) to explain, as it is not a stock price chart. 

If you provide the correct chart, I can give a proper analysis.
