This pie chart details CLX's quarterly volume distribution across eight periods, likely representing four quarters from 2023 and four from 2024.

The volume distribution is relatively consistent, with individual quarters contributing between 11.5% and 16.0% of the total observed volume. The highest single quarterly share was 16.0%, originating from a 2023 quarter, while the lowest was 11.5% from a 2024 quarter.
