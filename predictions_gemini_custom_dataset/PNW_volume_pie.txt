This pie chart illustrates the PNW Quarterly Volume Distribution, segmenting total volume across eight distinct quarters, with four quarters from 2023 and four from 2024.

Collectively, the four 2024 quarters represent a larger portion of the total volume at 57.5%, significantly outweighing the 42.6% contributed by the four 2023 quarters. The highest individual quarterly volume recorded is 17.7% (from a 2024 quarter), while the lowest is 8.9% (from a 2023 quarter). This suggests a stronger overall volume contribution from the sampled 2024 quarters compared to those from 2023.
